There are total 6 files of python provided by me. Each file have different codes. 
The first one here is assignment part-B ,
which is the solution of the question which we got in our assignment.The assignment was about creating functions within classes ,I used __init__() method in it. 

Then I did books.py
In that I created a class using name books and then in init i mentioned self,title,author and pages and printed the book info in the end.

In next, I created a file cars.py in this I created a class using name cars. 
In init function I mentioned self,name,speed and millage and then created a function named as car and used return to get all the three information together and printed it in the ending.

In circle.py I made a class using the name circle. In this file I created function to find area of the circle, circumference of the circle and to find if the area is greater than 20 or not.
Then I mentioned circle radius and area in the last and printed the information.

In fruit.py file I created a class and named it as fruit.
In init I added name and colour then i made another functions and mentioned the name and colour of the fruit in ending and called the function.

The last file is submit assignment.py
This was our Part-A of second assignment and in that we just had to create normal functions without using classes and init function. In that I have created total 4 functions.
